# Konami Code Project

This project is a fun implementation of the legendary Konami Code, made famous through its use in a number of games from Konami.

## Overview

The Konami Code was a cheat code that appeared in a number of games from Konami. One such game was Contra, an early NES game that popularized the code. Originally, Contra would start you with 3 lives per game, but if you entered the Konami Code after the start screen, you'd get a whopping 30 lives! The Konami Code goes as follows: Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Enter ( ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A Enter ).

Enter the Konami Code, and something interesting will happen...
