# Konami Code Project

This project is a fun implementation of the legendary Konami Code, made famous through its use in a number of games from Konami. Our homage takes the form of a web-based game that logs keyboard inputs and matches them against the sequence of the Konami Code.

## Overview

The Konami Code was a cheat code that appeared in a number of games from Konami. One such game was Contra, an early NES game that popularized the code. Originally, Contra would start you with 3 lives per game, but if you entered the Konami Code after the start screen, you'd get a whopping 30 lives! The Konami Code goes as follows: Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Enter ( ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A Enter ).

In our project, we've brought the Konami Code to life. Open your browser console and watch as your keyboard inputs are logged. Enter the Konami Code, and something interesting will happen...
